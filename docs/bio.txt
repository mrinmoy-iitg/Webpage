Developing my skills and qualities is always my prime objective. Challenges are refreshing, and stagnancy is boring. I thirst for knowledge, and I plan to keep it that way. Life is full of opportunities, and I am willing to grab the right one at the right time.

I am a Ph.D. student at the Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati. My Ph.D. thesis is based on performing movie genre classification using only the audio modality. I studied the speech and music signals in general and in the context of movies and TV broadcast signals and developed methods for their efficient discrimination. Subsequently, I used the speech and music information extracted from movie audio using the proposed algorithms for the genre classification of movies.

I have recently joined IIT Dharwad as a Senior Project Engineer in a project under the National Language Translation Mission of MeitY, Govt. of India. The project aims to develop efficient speaker recognition tools for different Indian languages. I am developing an open-source python-based toolkit to build speaker recognition systems for Indian languages. Before joining the Ph.D. program, I worked as an Assistant Project Engineer in a DST, Govt. of India sponsored project titled "Online handwriting recognition for Assamese language" at IIT Guwahati.
